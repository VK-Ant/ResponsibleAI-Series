## This repository is part of my Responsible AI learning journey.

Here, I explore how to build AI systems that are not only powerful, but also secure, safe, fair, and compliant.

---

## **What I’m Building**

- 🔐 LLM Security concepts

- 🛡️ Safety guardrails (PII, toxicity, prompt injection, hallucination checks)

- ⚖️ Bias detection pipeline

- 🏥 HIPAA-aware healthcare AI architecture

----

## **Why This Repository**

- I believe Responsible AI is not just theory.
- It must be built and tested in practice.

# **This is my personal learning journey, and I hope it helps others who are exploring similar paths in AI safety, governance, and production systems.**
